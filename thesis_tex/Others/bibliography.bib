abstract = {The capture of trace amounts of non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) from air due to the toxicity of volatile organic compounds is a significant challenge. A total of 31399 hydrophobic metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) were first screened from 137953 hypothetical MOFs using high-throughput computational screening (HTCS), and their performance indices (adsorption capacity and selectivity) for the adsorption of NMHCs (C3–C6) were obtained by molecular simulations. The discovery of a “second peak” near twice the kinetic diameter of the corresponding NMHC provided more choices for excellent MOFs that adsorb NMHCs. Four machine learning (ML) classification and regression algorithms predicted the performance of MOFs, and the relative importance values of the six descriptors were determined. The combination of the Random Forests algorithm and Molecular ACCess Systems molecular fingerprint (MF) had an excellent predictive ability for MOFs. According to the performance, the fingerprint commonalities of the 100 top-performing MOFs were counted, and the excellent bits (EBs) that could promote the performance were defined. Finally, new substructures containing all of the EBs were designed for each NMHC to build a new MOF database. This work combined the HTCS, ML, and MF to provide a detailed insight into the design of efficient MOFs for adsorbing NMHCs.}

abstract = {Recent studies have found multiple single nucleotide variants (SNVs) associated with DNA damage. However, previous association analysis may ignore the potential interaction effects between SNVs. Therefore, we used an improved random forest (RF) analysis to identify the SNVs related to personal DNA damage in exon-focused genome-wide association study (GWAS). A total of 301 subjects from three independent centers (Zhuhai, Wuhan, and Tianjin) were retained for analysis. An improved RF procedure was used to systematically screen key SNVs associated with DNA damage. Furthermore, we used genetic risk score (GRS) and mediation analysis to investigate the integrative effect and potential mechanism of these genetic variants on DNA damage. Besides, gene set enrichment analysis was conducted to identify the pathways enriched by key SNVs using the Data-driven Expression Prioritized Integration for Complex Traits (DEPICT). Finally, a set of 24 SNVs with the lowest mean square errors (MSE) were identified by improved RF analysis. Both weighted and unweighted GRSs were associated with increased DNA damage levels (Pweight < 0.001 and Punweight < 0.001). Gene set enrichment analysis indicated that these loci were significantly enriched in several biological features associated with DNA damage. These findings suggested the role of SNVs in modifying DNA damage levels. It may be convincing that this improved RF analysis can effectively identify SNVs associated with DNA damage levels.}

abstract = {In DNA microarray studies, gene-set analysis (GSA) has become the focus of gene expression data analysis. GSA utilizes the gene expression profiles of functionally related gene sets in Gene Ontology (GO) categories or priori-defined biological classes to assess the significance of gene sets associated with clinical outcomes or phenotypes. Many statistical approaches have been proposed to determine whether such functionally related gene sets express differentially (enrichment and/or deletion) in variations of phenotypes. However, little attention has been given to the discriminatory power of gene sets and classification of patients. In this study, we propose a method of gene set analysis, in which gene sets are used to develop classifications of patients based on the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The corresponding empirical p-value of an observed out-of-bag (OOB) error rate of the classifier is introduced to identify differentially expressed gene sets using an adequate resampling method. In addition, we discuss the impacts and correlations of genes within each gene set based on the measures of variable importance in the RF algorithm. Significant classifications are reported and visualized together with the underlying gene sets and their contribution to the phenotypes of interest. Numerical studies using both synthesized data and a series of publicly available gene expression data sets are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods. Compared with other hypothesis testing approaches, our proposed methods are reliable and successful in identifying enriched gene sets and in discovering the contributions of genes within a gene set. The classification results of identified gene sets can provide an valuable alternative to gene set testing to reveal the unknown, biologically relevant classes of samples or patients. In summary, our proposed method allows one to simultaneously assess the discriminatory ability of gene sets and the importance of genes for interpretation of data in complex biological systems. The classifications of biologically defined gene sets can reveal the underlying interactions of gene sets associated with the phenotypes, and provide an insightful complement to conventional gene set analyses.}

abstract = {Accurately identifying protein-metal ion ligand binding residues is the key to study protein functions. Because the number of binding residues and non-binding residues is significantly imbalanced, false positives is hard to be eliminated from the binding residues prediction result. Therefore, identification of protein-metal ion ligand binding residues remains challenging. In this paper, the binding site of 7 metal ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Fe3+, Mn2+, Cu2+ and Co2+) were used as the objects of the study. Besides generally adopted parameters: amino acids and predicted secondary structure information, we creatively introduced ten orthogonal properties as a parameter. These orthogonal properties are clustering of 188 physical and chemical characteristics that can be used to describe three-dimension structural information. With the optimized parameters, we used the Random Forest algorithm to predict ion ligand binding residues. The proposed method obtained good prediction results with the MCC values of Mg2+, Ca2+ and Zn2+ reaching 0.255, 0.254, 0.540, respectively. Comparing to the IonSeq method, the method developed in this paper has advantages on the binding residues prediction of some ions.}

abstract = {In biochemistry, the protein structure prediction from the primary sequence is a significant issue. Few research works are intended for performing protein structure prediction with assist of diverse data mining techniques. However, the existing technique does not provide enhanced performance for protein structure prediction. To resolve this limitation, Weighted Pearson Correlation based Improved Random Forest Classification (WPC-IRFC) Technique is introduced. The WPC-IRFC Technique is developed for enhancing the protein structure prediction performance with higher accuracy and lesser time. The WPC-IRFC uses Weighted Pearson Correlation (WPC) to select relevant amino acid features based on weighted mean and weighted covariance. After selecting the relevant amino acid features, WPC-IRFC Technique designs an Improved Random Forest Classification (IRFC) for predicting the protein structure from a big protein dataset (DS). IRFC significantly lessens the error rate of classification with aid of iteratively reweighted least squares model to accurately identify protein structures.}
